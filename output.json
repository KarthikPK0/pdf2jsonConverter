    "Devices in which a controlled flow of electrons can be obtained are the basic building blocks of all the electronic circuits. Before the discovery of transistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called valves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often called plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes – cathode, plate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes). In a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and the controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying the voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the energy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices the electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one direction). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves. These vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate generally at high voltages (~100 V) and have limited life and low reliability. electronics goes back to 1930’s when it was realised that some solid- state semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling the number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them. Simple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change the number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply ELECTRONICS: MATERIALS, DEVICES 2024-25",
    "Physics 324 and flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the solid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons were obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an evacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space is required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume low power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability. Even the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer monitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced by Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state electronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices was formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead sulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as detector of radio waves. semiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like junction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a 3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also be described. On the basis of conductivity On the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity ( s) or resistivity ( r = 1/s), the solids are broadly classified as: (i)Metals: They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity). r ~ 10 –2 – 10 –8 W m s ~ 10 2 – 10 8 S m –1 (ii)Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate to metals and insulators. r ~ 10 –5 – 10 6 W m s ~ 10 5 – 10 –6 S m –1 (iii)Insulators: They have high resistivity (or low conductivity). r ~ 10 11 – 10 19 W m s ~ 10 –11 – 10 –19 S m –1 The values of r and s given above are indicative of magnitude and could well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity semiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which will become clear as we go along in this chapter. Our interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which could be: (i)Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge (ii)Compound semiconductors: Examples are: ∑Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc. ∑Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc. Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on semiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using 2024-25",

The general concepts introduced here for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply to most of the compound semiconductors as well. On the basis of energy bands According to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of any of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when the atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So the outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very close or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion in a solid very different from that in an isolated atom. Inside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two electrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because of this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different valence electrons is called the valence band . The energy band above the valence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all the valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in the conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the valence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into the conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when it overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is the case with metallic conductors. If there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence band, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons insulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain external energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the valence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band. At the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band where other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the possibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as due to vacancies in the valence band. Let us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing N atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while for Ge it is the fourth orbit (n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost orbit is 4 (2s and 2p electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons in the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of electrons in the outer orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, for the 4N valence electrons there are 8N available energy states. These 8N discrete energy levels can either depending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box on Band Theory of Solids). At the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge, the energy band of these 8N states is split apart into two which are g completely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute called the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero. 2024-25",

When there is overlap electrons from valence band can electrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is partially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level making conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials is low or the conductivity is high. 2024-25",
    "327 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits Case II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap E g exists (E g > 3 eV). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore no electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large band by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators. Case III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small band gap (E g < 3 eV) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room electrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band. Hence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the insulators. conductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will learn the conduction process in semiconductors. We shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose lattice structure is shown in Fig. 14.3. These structures surrounded by four nearest neighbours. We know that Si and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline structure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its neighbour atoms, and also to take share of one electron from each such neighbour. These shared electron pairs valence bond. The two shared electrons can be assumed to shuttle back-and-forth between the associated atoms holding them together strongly. Figure 14.4 schematically structure shown in Fig. 14.3 which overemphasises the covalent bond. It shows an idealised picture in which no bonds are broken (all bonds are intact). Such a situation arises at low temperatures. As the temperature increases, more thermal energy becomes available to these electrons and some of these electrons may break–away (becoming free electrons contributing to conduction). The thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms in the crystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the bond as shown in Fig. 14.5(a). The neighbourhood, from which the free electron (with charge – q) has come out leaves a vacancy with an effective charge (+q). This vacancy with the effective positive electronic charge is called a hole. The hole behaves as an apparent free particle with effective positive charge. In intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free electrons, n e is equal to the number of holes, n h n e = n h = n i (14.1) where n i is called intrinsic carrier concentration. Semiconductors posses the unique property in which, apart from electrons, the holes also move. Suppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown to 3.56, 5.43 and 5.66 Å. 2024-25",
    "Physics 328 in Fig. 14.5(a). The movement of holes can be visualised as shown in Fig. 14.5(b). An electron from the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to the vacant site 1 (hole). Thus, after such a jump, the hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an moved from site 1 to site 2. Note that the electron originally set free [Fig. 14.5(a)] is not involved in this process of hole motion. The free electron moves completely independently as conduction electron and gives rise to an electron current, I e under an applied electric field. Remember that the motion of hole is only a convenient way of describing the actual motion of bound electrons, whenever there is an empty bond anywhere in the crystal. Under the action of an electric field, giving the hole current, I h . The total current, I is thus the sum of the electron current I e and the hole current I h : I = I e + I h (14.2) It may be noted that apart from the process of generation of conduction electrons and holes, a simultaneous process of recombination occurs in which the electrons recombine with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of generation is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The recombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole. apparent movement of the hole from site 1 to site 2. (a)(b) 2024-25",

Here, band leaving equal number of holes there. g least for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free small for C. temperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As conductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities. When a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable impurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the addition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms are called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor. The dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure semiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain this is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should be nearly the same. There are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si or Ge: (i)Pentavalent (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous (P), etc. 2024-25",
    "Physics 330 Boron (B), Aluminium (Al), etc. changes the number of charge carriers (and hence the conductivity) of semiconductors. Si or Ge belongs to the fourth group in the Periodic table and, therefore, we choose the group, expecting and taking care that the size of the dopant atom is nearly the same as that of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent and trivalent dopants in Si or Ge give two entirely different types of semiconductors as discussed below. Suppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent element as shown in Fig. 14.7. When an atom of an atom in the crystal lattice of Si, four of because the four electrons participating in bonding are seen as part of the effective core of the atom by the fifth electron. As a result electron free is very small and even at room lattice of the semiconductor. For example, the energy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium, electron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump the forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for pentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and available for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the doping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature. On the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number of holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature. In a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons n e is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated intrinsically, while the total number of holes n h is only due to the holes from the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would increase due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the number of holes would get reduced further. Thus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons can be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic P, etc.) doped for tetravalent Si or Ge giving n- 2024-25",

For n-type semiconductors, we have, n e >> n h (14.3) This is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity like Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than Si or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with neighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to offer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth shown in Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice orbit of an atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this vacancy, leaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole is available for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom becomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth electron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom of p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge along with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is obvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are in addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source of conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for such a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons are minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped with trivalent impurity are called p-type semiconductors. For p-type semiconductors, the recombination process will reduce i e . We have, for p-type semiconductors n h >> n e (14.4) Note that the crystal maintains an overall charge neutrality opposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice. In extrinsic semiconductors, because of the abundance of thermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and thus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of current carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly helps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers. The semiconductor’s energy band structure is affected by doping. In the case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor impurities (E ) and acceptor impurities (E ) also exist. In the energy band diagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level E is slightly below the bottom E of the conduction band and electrons from this level move into the conduction band with very small supply of energy. At room temperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (~10 12 ) coming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly, acceptor atom (In, Al, B etc.) only the fixed core of the 2024-25",
    "Physics 332 for p-type semiconductor, the acceptor energy level E is slightly above the top E of the valence band as shown in Fig. 14.9(b). With very small supply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level and ionise the acceptor negatively. (Alternately, we can also say that with very small supply of energy the hole from level E sinks down into the valence band. Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain external energy.) At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get ionised leaving holes in the valence band. Thus at room temperature the density of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in the extrinsic semiconductor.

    "333 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits A p-n junction is the basic building block of many semiconductor devices like diodes, transistor, etc. A clear understanding of the junction behaviour We will now try to understand how a junction is formed and how the junction behaves under the influence of external applied voltage (also called bias). Consider a thin p-type silicon (p-Si) semiconductor wafer. By adding precisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer semiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and n-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region. Two important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction: concentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration concentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side to n-side (p Æ n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n Æ p). This motion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction. When an electron diffuses from n Æ p, it leaves behind an ionised donor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is bonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse from n Æ p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on n-side of the junction is developed. Similarly, when a hole diffuses from p Æ n due to the concentration gradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is immobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or negative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed. This space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known part in the initial movement across the junction depleted the region of its free charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness micrometre. Due to the positive space-charge region on n-side of the junction and negative space charge region on p-side of the junction, an electric field directed from positive charge towards negative charge develops. Due to this field, an electron on p-side of the junction moves to n-side and a hole on n-side of the junction moves to p- side. The motion of charge carriers due to the electric field direction to the diffusion current (Fig. 14.10) starts. Formation and working of p- n junction diode http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/pnjun.html 2024-25",
    "Physics 334 Initially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small. As the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions on either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric until the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n junction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there is no net current. the junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is such as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of equilibrium exists. Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at material. Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of electron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a physically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction? continuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible. The junction A semiconductor diode [Fig. 14.12(a)] is basically a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for the application of an external voltage. It is a two terminal device. A p-n junction diode is symbolically represented as shown in Fig. 14.12(b). The direction of arrow indicates the conventional direction of current (when the diode is under forward bias). The equilibrium barrier potential can be altered by applying an external voltage V across the diode. The (without bias) is shown in Fig. 14.11(a) and (b). When an external voltage V is applied across a semiconductor diode such that p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and n-side to the negative terminal [Fig. 14.13(a)], it is said to be forward biased. The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the voltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible. (This is because the resistance of the depletion region – a region where and p-side.) The direction of the applied voltage (V) is opposite to the n p 2024-25",
    "335 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits 0 decreases and the barrier height is reduced [Fig. 14.13(b)]. The effective barrier height under forward bias is (V 0 – V). If the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be reduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a small number of carriers in the material—those that happen to be in the uppermost energy levels—will possess enough energy to cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase the applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced and more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus the current increases. Due to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the carries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach the n-side (where they are minority carries). This process under concentration increases significantly compared to the locations far from the junction. Due to this concentration gradient, the injected electrons on p-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end of p-side. Likewise, the injected holes on n-side diffuse from the (Fig. 14.14). This motion of charged carriers on either side gives rise to current. The total diode forward current is sum of hole diffusion current and conventional current due to electron diffusion. The magnitude of this current is usually in mA. When an external voltage (V) is applied across the diode such that n-side is positive and p-side is negative, it is said to be drops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same as the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases and the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field. The effective barrier height under reverse bias is (V 0 + V), [Fig. 14.15(b)]. This suppresses the flow of electrons from n Æ p and holes from p Æ n. Thus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode under forward bias. The electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on junction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers gives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few mA. This is quite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority side to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also there under forward bias but it is negligible (mA) when compared with current due to injected carriers which is usually in mA. The diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied voltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers from one side of the junction to the other side of the junction. The current 2024-25",
    "Physics 336 is not limited by the magnitude of the applied voltage but is limited due to the concentration of the minority carrier on either side of the junction. breakdown voltage (V br ). When V = V br , the diode reverse current increases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes large change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by manufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed. Once it exceeds the rated value, the diode gets destroyed due to overheating. This can happen even for the diode under forward bias, if the forward current exceeds the rated value. The circuit arrangement for studying the V-I characteristics of a diode, (i.e., the variation of current as a function of applied voltage) are shown in Fig. 14.16(a) and (b). The battery is connected to the diode through a potentiometer (or reheostat) so that the applied voltage to the diode can be changed. For different values of voltages, the value of the current is noted. A graph between V and I is obtained as in Fig. 14.16(c). Note that in forward bias measurement, we use a milliammeter since the expected current is large (as explained in the earlier section) while a micrometer is used in reverse bias to measure the current. You can see in Fig. 14.16(c) that in forward 2024-25",
    "337 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits bias, the current first increases very slowly, almost negligibly, till the voltage across the diode crosses a certain value. After the characteristic voltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for a very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the ~0.7 V for silicon diode). For the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (~mA) and almost current. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down voltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode is discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not used beyond the reverse saturation current region. The above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly allows the flow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward bias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This property is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next section. For diodes, we define a quantity called dynamic resistance as the ratio of small change in voltage DV to a small change in current DI: d r ∆ = ∆ (14.6) the Fig. 14.17. Calculate the resistance of the diode at (a) I = 15 mA and (b) V = –10 V.

    "Physics 338 From the V-I characteristic of a junction diode we see that it allows current to pass only when it is forward biased. So if an alternating voltage is applied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle when the diode is forward biased. This property circuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier. If an alternating voltage is applied across a diode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will appear across the load only during the half cycles of the ac input during which the diode is forward secondary of a transformer supplies the desired ac voltage across terminals A and B. When the voltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased and it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is reverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse saturation current of a diode is negligible and can be considered equal to zero for practical purposes. (The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must be sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at the secondary of the transformer to protect the diode from reverse breakdown.) Therefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there is a current through the load resistor R and we get an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18(b), whereas there is no current in the negative half- cycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get the output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is rectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is called as half-wave rectifier. The circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output rectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative half of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the p-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the transformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together and the output is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint secondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it is called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen from Fig.14.19(c) the voltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage. Each diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate cycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centre- tap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output.

It is clear that, at that instant, negative as shown in Fig.14.19(b). So, diode 1 gets forward biased and conducts (while 2 being reverse biased is not conducting). Hence, during this positive half cycle we get an output current (and a output voltage Fig.14.19(c). In the course of the ac cycle when the voltage at A becomes negative with respect to centre tap, the voltage at B would be positive. In this part of the cycle diode 1 would not conduct but diode D 2 would, voltage (across R ) during the negative half cycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output voltage during both the positive as well as the negative half of the cycle. Obviously, this is a more efficient circuit for getting rectified voltage or current than the half- wave rectifier. The rectified voltage is in the form of Though it is unidirectional it does not have capacitor is connected across the output terminals (parallel to the load R ). One can also use an inductor in series with R for the same purpose. Since these additional called filters. charged. If there is no external load, it remains charged to the peak voltage of the rectified output. When there is a load, it gets discharged through the load and the voltage across it begins to fall. In the next half-cycle of rectified output it again gets charged to the peak value (Fig. 14.20). The rate of fall of the voltage across the capacitor depends inversely upon the product of capacitance C and the effective resistance R used in the circuit C should be large. So capacitor input filters use large capacitors. The output voltage obtained by using capacitor input filter is nearer to the peak voltage of the rectified voltage. This type of filter is most widely used in power supplies. diode D 1 at A and to the diode D 2 at B; 2024-25",

Further, the material possesses an overall charge neutrality. band energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. All energy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the conduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in the conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for the conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy gap (E g ) between the top of valence band (E ) and the bottom of the conduction band E .
